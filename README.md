# Community-Resolve
A city issue reporting platform that allows residents to report everyday problems like potholes, missed garbage collection, and graffiti directly to local authorities. Features include issue descriptions, photo uploads, map locations, and live status updates—enhancing communication, transparency, and accountability for a better urban experience.
# Abstract
In today’s fast-changing cities, residents face many everyday problems—like potholes, missed garbage collection, blocked drains, and graffiti—that can disrupt community life. These issues often go unreported because it’s hard for people to contact local authorities. To solve this, we created an easy-to-use website where city residents can report their problems directly to the right departments. The website allows users to describe their issues, upload pictures for better understanding, and mark the exact location on a map. This makes it easier for local authorities to respond quickly. A live leaderboard shows how many complaints each department has received, resolved, and still needs to handle, promoting openness and accountability. The website also keeps residents updated on the status of their complaints, encouraging them to get involved and take responsibility for their neighbourhood’s. By modernizing the way non-emergency urban issues are managed through this platform, we aim to improve communication between residents and local authorities, enhancing the quality of life for everyone in the city.
# Problem Statement
In busy urban areas, residents often find it difficult to report non-emergency issues like potholes, missed waste collections, and blocked drains due to ineffective communication systems. The old ways of reporting these problems are slow and frustrating, leading to delayed responses and feelings of helplessness. Additionally, the current systems lack user-friendliness, making it hard for residents to get their issues addressed.
Local governments need to gather and organize data better so they can allocate resources effectively and create appropriate response strategies. This fragmentation reduces community involvement because it does not clearly show how reported issues are followed up. By using a unified website as a tool to improve the sharing of information between the public and local authorities, we can foster better teamwork and create a more responsive urban environment that truly meets the needs of residents.
